title 0.6: SPA: New note

Browser->Server: Hello Mr. S! Here is my new note - HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

note right of Server: 
- SPA doesn't fetch .css / .js files again, it fetched them in the initial request when the /spa page was loaded
- POST request already contains the new note (with both fields, content & date) as JSON data
- content-type header tells server in which format the data is send (application/json; charset=utf-8)
- e.preventDefault() prevents the default handling of the form submit (sending the data to the server and causing a new GET request)
end note

Server-->Browser: Oh, hello Mrs. B! I got your note. No need to send any additional request, here is your note and all the other notes
